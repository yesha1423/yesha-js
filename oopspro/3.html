    //   first of all we  create the main class called "Vehicle". This class has one constructor which have two argument named "make" and "model".It has a calling method "getInfo()"
    //   and than we can extends to "Vehicle" and class named Car. Than we added new argument named "year". Then we used keyword named "super". can reuse the to the method called "getInfo()". 
    //   we can access all methods from the main class called "Vehicle".Here we stored value of car with argumenrs into myCar. Then we called "getInfo()".
