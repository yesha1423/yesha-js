    //  first of all we  create the main class called "Animal". This class has one constructor which have argument named "name", and it has a calling method "speak()"
    //  and than we can extends to Animal and class named Dog. Than we can reuse the to the method called "speak()".At this time output:Buddy Barks     // Output: Buddy barks.
    //  because  of the use of "extends", we can access all methods from the main class called "Animal".Here we stored value of Dog into dog. Then we called "speak()".
